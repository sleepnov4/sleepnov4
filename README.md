### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for reaching out my Github Profile. I'm still not good at programming, but I want to learn more some programming languages.

Currently, I'm learning **JavaScript**, and some web programming languages such as **HTML**, **CSS** & **PHP** and learning some web frameworks such as **Laravel** and for front-end framework, I'm learning
**React.js**.

I have a community for gaming and talking some tech stuff (programming discussion, etc). You can join my community on Discord (https://discord.gg/4U4k6bW)
